A template for working with purescript and halogen, and using webapck as bundler.

<i>Note for windows users:
The spago installations appear to be buggy on windows. If you encounter a 
"Permission Denied" on FileMoveEx - close your editors (vs code, sublime,
webstorm, etc.) and than try installing from command line. After dependency
installation is done, there does not appear to be any more problems with a
windows setup.</i>
