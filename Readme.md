A template for working with purescript and halogen, and using webapck as bundler.

<i>Note for windows users:
The installation appears to be buggy, and also installing additional purescript
packages with spago is. If you encounter a Permission Denied on FileMoveEx -
close your editors (vs code, sublime, webstorm, etc.) and than installing from 
command line. After dependency installation is done, there does not appear to
be any more problems with a windows setup.</i>
